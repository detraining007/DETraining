lambda arguments: expression

lambda is the keyword.
arguments are like parameters to a normal function.
expression is a single expression (no statements) that gets returned.

Use Cases:
Passed as a function to:
map(), filter(), sorted(), reduce()
Inside list comprehensions or UI callbacks
Data processing pipelines

Returns:
Always returns a function object that can be called.

Performance:
*Faster than def functions in terms of lookup time for small one-liners.
*But no major speed-up in practical scenarios on large datasets â€” the real bottleneck is usually in logic, not function call.
*Lambda + built-in functions (like map/filter) can be slightly faster than for-loops or named function combos, especially in 
 functional-style pipelines.

Limitations:
Only one expression, no multiple statements.
Cannot contain return, print, assignments.
Not reusable or debuggable like def.

Best Practices:
Use for short, one-time operations.

Avoid if:
Logic is complex
You need debugging or reuse
You need readability (especially in large codebases)
